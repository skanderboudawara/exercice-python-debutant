**Keep in mind that there is no single way or single path to solving programming problems.** The solutions provided here are just one approach among many possible implementations. Programming is creative, and there are often multiple correct ways to achieve the same result.

We encourage you to:
- Try solving the problems yourself first
- Compare your solutions with ours
- Experiment with different approaches
- Don't be afraid to make mistakes - they're part of learning!
